#[OC] Probabilities for Each Round of 16 match-up in the Champions League
Hi /r/soccer,

To calculate the probabilities I wrote a little program in Python that simulates a draw. The results are based on around 670,000 simulations.

I think this can be easily adapted to the Europa League round of 32, but I'll have to check whether the rules are the same. In that case, I will make a post for that too.

If you're interested in looking at the source code, it's on my [Github.](https://github.com/TommasoAmici/champions_league_r16)
