# Simulated draws for the Champions League round of 16 and Europa League round of 32

A Python program to simulate the draws and calculate the probabilities for each match up in the Champions League round of 16.

Usage:

`python3 round16CL.py [number of simulations]`

`python3 round32EL.py [number of simulations]`

A million simulations take about 2 minutes and produce about 670,000 valid match ups for the Champions League.
A million simulations take about 10 minutes and produce about 900,000 valid match ups for the Europa League.

The pandas output is printed to the terminal and it's saved to a .csv file.
